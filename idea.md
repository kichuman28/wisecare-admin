Problem Statement 
As the elderly population in India continues to grow, many seniors face significant 
challenges, including: 
1. Social Isolation: Many elderly individuals live alone or without regular interaction with 
family and friends, leading to loneliness and mental health issues. 
2. Limited Access to Healthcare: Seniors often struggle to access timely medical 
consultations, medication management, and healthcare services due to mobility 
issues or lack of transportation. 
3. Safety Concerns: Elderly individuals are at risk of falls and health emergencies, 
which may go unnoticed without proper monitoring. 
4. Family Distance: Many children live abroad or far from their aging parents, making it 
difficult for them to provide support and ensure their well-being.
